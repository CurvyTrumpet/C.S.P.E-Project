<p>Trials show that this vaccine has overall effectiveness of 70.4%. However, the vaccine was given to one group of volunteers as two standard doses, which showed 62% effectiveness but another group of volunteers was given a smaller dose, followed by a standard dose, which increased effectiveness to 90%. It is not clear why this is the case. Professor Andrew Pollard, one of the lead researchers on the project, described the data as "intriguing".</p>
